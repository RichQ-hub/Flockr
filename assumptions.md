# Assumptions
For our assumptions, we assume that all variables adhere to what the spec stated as their type.

## auth.py
#### Parameter Assumptions
- Limitations on `password` **128 characters**. (based on research)
- Limitations on `email` **320 characters**. (based on research)
- `email` should only contain **alpha numeric characters** and **special characters** (no emojis)
- `password` can only contain the visible ASCII values on the ascii table (characters available on keyboard)
- `email` can contain special characters (no emojis), but they cant be consecutive and cant be at the start or end of the email address (before the @).
- `email` should contain an @ and a '.' after the @ symbol
- The same `email` cannot be registered twice.
- `email` domains can have multiple dots (e.g. company emails, or .uk emails)
- `emails` are not case sensitive, and are stored in lowercase form.
- `name_first` and `name_last` have a **minimum** character length of **1** and a **maximum** character length of **50** (both inclusive).
- `name_first` and `name_last` must not contain special characters or numbers other than **'-'**. Furthermore, characters can only be in the English alphabet.
- Inputted **strings** do not contain characters from other languages/cultures.
- Handle strings are concatenated from the first letter of the `name_first` and the remaining 19 letters from `name_last` 


#### Implementation Assumptions
- Registering automatically logs the user in.
- Handle strings are **20 characters** long.
- The first person to register is the **flockr owner**.
- The user should not be able to log in when they already logged in cannot login if not registered
- cannot logout if not logged in


## channel.py
- **Owners** of a channel must be members of that channel as well.

### Flockr Ownership in Channels
From our interpretation of the spec, we made the following assumptions regarding the user with **flockr ownership permissions**:
- **flockr owner** can use `channel_join` to join **private** channels
- For iteration 1, we assume that if the user with **flockr ownership permissions** joins to a channel by either using `channel_invite` or `channel_join`, the **flockr owner** immediately becomes one of the owners of the channel (treating **flockr ownership permissions** and **channel owners** as the same).
- `channel_removeowner`can be used to remove the **flockr owner** as an owner of the channel. The **flockr owner** will now instead be a member of the channel.

### channel_details
- Assuming that the return order of `owner_members` and `all_members` is when the user became a **member** or **owner**.

### channel_invite
- When a user is invited to a channel, he/she assumes **member** permissions in the channel.
- **Members** can invite other members to channel without being the owner of the channel.
- **User** is not allowed to invite him/herself to channel, in which case an AccessError will be presented
- **User** is not allowed to invite the same user more than once, in which case an AccessError will be presented
- When a member invites a flockr owner to channel, the flockr owner automatically assumes the position of **owner** in the channel too

### channel_messages
- If no messages have been made in a channel, both the `start` and `end` value will be **-1** (to differentiate between 0 and 1 message since start is the first index of the message).
- The `start` parameter will always be positive (including 0).

### channel_leave
- If all owners have left but there are still members in the channel, the user with the lowest `u_id` automatically becomes the new owner of the channel.
- When everyone has left the channel, the channel will automatically be deleted from the database.
- `channel_leave` will remove user access to a channel and also that channel will never appear again when `channel_list` is called.
- When an owner leaves the channel, the owner status will be **cleared**. This means that if the user joins back to the channel using either `channel_invite` or `channel_join`, they will instead have **member permissions** initially (exemption applies to flockr owner).

### channel_join
- If an owner has left (the one who created the channel) and if they are joined back to the channel, the user will now have **member** permissions rather than **owner** permissions.
- A user that is a member of the channel can call `channel_join` as many times as they want however, for this case, it will do nothing instead.


### channel_addowner
- Any owner in the channel can add any user in flockr with the specified `u_id` as an owner of the channel. Furthermore, the user will now become a **member** of the channel.


### channel_removeowner
- If a user has been **removed** as an owner of a channel, they are still **member** of that channel.


## channels.py
- The user that has created a channel will automatically become the first **member** and **owner** of that channel.
- Channel `name` must be between **1 to 20 characters (inclusive)**. 
- Only users that are logged in are able to list channels (Both the users are a part of and not).
- Assume that created channels are going to be listed in order channel_id (in ascending order of when it was created) when `channels_list` and `channels_listall` are called.
- `channels_listall` list all public and private channels.

## user.py
### user_profile_setname
- if an empty string '' is inputted for either `name_first` or `name_last`, we do not change the field
- `name_first` and `name_last` can only contain letters from the english alphabet and can only contain the special character **'-'**
- two different users can have the same `name_first` and `name_last`

## message.py



## other.py
### admin_userpermission_change
- The first flockr owner (the first person that register) can never become a member user. If the `u_id` of the first flockr owner is given, it will raise an `InputError`
- Flockr owners can also change their own permission_id (i.e. an owner can become a member themselves).
- If a flockr owner calls admin_userpermission_change with the same `permission_id` as previous (i.e. owner becomes owner, member becomes member), the function will do nothing as they have the same `permission_id` already.
